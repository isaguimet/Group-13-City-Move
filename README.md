Info:
- All files for demo 1 are found in the master branch of this repository (City-Move).
- All .java files need to be compiled, followed by running the Survey Class.
  - To do so: change the directory of the command prompt to be in the same location as where all the files are located, followed by compiling the code by typing in ---> javac *.java (Compilation will be successful if no error messages pop up after compiling)
  - To run the survey class, type in ---> java Survey.
