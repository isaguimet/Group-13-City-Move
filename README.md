Info:
- All files for demo 2 are found in the Demo-2 branch of this repository (City-Move).
- All .java files need to be compiled, followed by running the Gui Class.
- To do so: change the directory of the command prompt to be in the same location as where all the files are located, followed by compiling the code by typing in ---> javac *.java (Compilation will be successful if no error messages pop up after compiling)
- To run the Gui class, type in ---> java Gui
- When running the Gui class for the first time, enter a username and password you will use for each time you rerun the program.
- In order to do this, ---> Enter your username and password in the textfields, and click "Signup"
- If account creation is succesful, it will prompt you to click "Login" (or hit the enter key) and will direct you to the main menu.
- If you have already ran the Gui class once and have created a username and password, enter your username and password and click "Login" (or hit the enter key), which will direct you to the main menu.
- To run the survey in the Gui, click on "Do Survey" in the main menu.
